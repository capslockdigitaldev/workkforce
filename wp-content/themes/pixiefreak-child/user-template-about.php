			<p>Youth sports and activities were always an important part of David Stephens’ family life. 
			In 2000, David‘s experience as a parent of active children and as a youth and select team coach formed the foundation for the launch of PrimeTime Sports. 
			What began in June 2000 as a 26 team basketball tournament in Plano, TX, has grown into a premier, sports-event management company, which includes: </p>
			</br>
			<p>    • Events and programs in 3 different sports, basketball, soccer, and 7 on 7 football </br>
    • More than 150 events on 48 different weekends in more than 20 different states</br>
    • Hosts the largest single venue youth basketball national championship in the country with 831 teams participating in 2016 and more than 900 teams expected in 2017.</br>
    • Hosts annually the Play Hard, Live Well Sports Expo, which had more than 50 exhibitors and 10,000 attendees in 2014.</p>
			</br></br>
			<p>While the cornerstone sport for PrimeTime Sports was basketball, 
			the company has expanded its sports offerings.  In 2004, PrimeTime Sports added school based competitive 7 on 7 football tournaments.  
			A 3rd sport was added in 2005, when PrimeTime Sports began offering competitive youth soccer tournaments and leagues.</p>
